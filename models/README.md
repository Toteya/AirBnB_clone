match = re.search(r"^(\w*)\.(\w+)(?:\(([^)]*)\))$", line):

^: This anchors the search at the beginning of the string.

(\w*): This is a capturing group that matches zero or more word characters (letters, digits, or underscores). This captures the class name in the class.method(args) format.

\.: This matches a literal dot (period), which is used to separate the class name from the method name.

(\w+): This is another capturing group that matches one or more word characters. This captures the method name.

(?:\(([^)]*)\)): This is a non-capturing group that matches a pair of parentheses () containing any characters except a closing parenthesis ). The [^)]* part matches any characters except a closing parenthesis zero or more times. This captures the arguments inside the parentheses.

So, the regular expression is used to match the following pattern:

class.method(args)

class is captured by the first capturing group (\w*).
method is captured by the second capturing group (\w+).
args inside the parentheses are captured by the third capturing group ([^)]*).
The re.search function searches for this pattern in the input string line and returns a match object if the pattern is found. The match object contains the captured groups, which can be accessed using the group() method. In your code, these captured groups are used to extract the class name, method name, and arguments from the input command.
